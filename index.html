                  <h2>Allan Kardec</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Author of 5 books which are the pillar of the Spiritism.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/allan_kardec.jpg" alt="Alan Kardec">
<p>
AKA Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail – the French educator, translator and author, was born in 3 October 1804 and died in 31 March 1869.
</p>
<p>
Son of an honorable family, he was sent to study at the the Pestalozzi Institution, in Switzerland. Back in France he devoted himself to teaching, writing pedagogical books, translating, etc. He was always a member of several societies, and that is an indication of the variety of his knowledge, his practical mind activity, and his constant endeavour to be useful to his fellowmen.
</p>
<p>
Witnessing the phenomenon of “table-turning” and others which were exciting the attention of Europe and America, he was skeptical at first. However, he soon envisaged the real nature of those phenomena, the intelligent causes behind them which unite the material and spiritual realms. He started a careful study, and two years later he had his ideas and convictions changed.
</p>
<p>
Kardec had compiled thousands of questions and the answers given by the spirits through several mediums spread throughout Europe and North America. The topics covered the nature and mechanisms of communications with spirits, the reasons for human life on earth, life in the spirit realm, reincarnation, among other philosophical and scientific subjects.
</p>
<p>
Kardec had in hands instructions that constituted, by his own words, “an entirely new theory of human life, duty, and destiny, that appears to me to be perfectly rational and coherent, admirably lucid and consoling, and intensely interesting. Those became the basis for the Spiritist Codification published under the pen name Allan Kardec:
</p>
<ul style="text-align: left">
  <li>The Spirits’ Book, (1857)</li>
  <li>The Medium’s Book (1861)</li>
  <li>The Gospel According to Spiritism (1864)</li>
  <li>Heaven and Hell (1865)</li>
  <li>The Genesis (1868)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Until his death in 1869, Kardec also published the periodical The Spiritist Review, among other works of no lesser value.

                  <h2>Spiritism</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">
Spiritism has shed light upon a great many questions.  Which until now were unanswered or to which the answers were poorly understood.”<br>
Allan Kardec from his book “What is Spiritism.”.
</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/spiritism.jpg" alt="Spiritism">
<p>
Spiritism contains multiple aspects. The scientific aspect studies the existence and nature of spirits, which are nothing more than the immortal souls of men, created by God.
</p><p>
The philosophical aspect, derived from a deep study from information received during communication with discarnate spirits, deals with details of the spirit’s life and evolutionary journey through the reincarnation process. A natural consequence of that that philosophy is the understanding of the role we play in our own spiritual evolution, which is ultimately achieved through the efforts we make to grow, both morally and intellectually.
</p><p>
Spiritism helps us to understand the natural laws that govern evolutionary process. From a moral perspective, we follow the teachings and examples of Jesus Christ, as our model and guide.
</p><p>
The religious aspect stems from the moral ties between ourselves, and others, and the direction that Spiritism leads us, toward God, our creator, by helping us to understand life and by teaching us, ultimately, how to develop the ability to love, in the greatest sense of the word.

                  <h1>Paul of Tarsus</h1>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Paul of Tarsus is one of the most important figures of the Christianity.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/paul_of_tarsus.jpg" alt="Paul of Tarsus">

<p>
Paul is generally considered one of the most important figures of the Apostolic Age and in the mid-30s to the mid-50s AD he founded several churches in Asia Minor and Europe. He took advantage of his status as both a Jew (aka Saul)  and a Roman citizen (aka Paul) to minister to both Jewish and Roman audiences.
</p><p>
Paul of Tarsus, was born early in the first century A.D. in  Cilicia what is now Turkey, was also known by the Jewish name of Saul.  His parents came from Gischala, in Galilee, according to Jerome. Paul was executed in Rome, under Nero, in about A.D. 67.
</p><p>
Paul or Saul, as he was originally called, a tent-maker, was a Pharisee who was educated and spent many years in Jerusalem (until about A.D. 34, according to PBS). He was on his way to Damascus to continue his mission of stamping out converts to the new Jewish sect of Christians when he experienced a vision of Jesus to him in a great light, which he describes in Acts 9:1 – 9 (also Gal.1:15–16). He was struck blind, but after three days his sight was restored by Ananias of Damascus and Paul became a missionary, spreading the message of Christianity. He also wrote a large part of the New Testament.
</p><p>
When Stephen, the first Christian to be martyred, was killed by being stoned to death, Paul was present. Paul supported the killing and was, at the time, attempting to stamp out the new Jewish, Christ-worshiping sect.
</p><p>
Three years from that day he began his famous missions to the west, first preaching in his native Syria and Cilicia (Galatians 1:17–24). During the next 20 years or so (c. AD mid-30s to mid-50s), he established several churches in Asia Minor and at least three in Europe, including the church at Corinth.
</p><p>
Paul had many enemies and detractors, among jews because he gained a reputation for being against their religious traditions, and among gentiles for drawing people away from pagan cults. Therefore, Paul and the other missionaries were subject to criticism, abuse, and punishment as we can learn through the narrative of the Acts.
</p><p>
In the late AD-50s Paul returned to Jerusalem where he was arrested for taking a Gentile too far into the Temple precincts, and sent to Caesarea. Two years later, Paul was to be sent to Jerusalem for trial, but preferred, instead, to be sent to Rome, where he arrived in A.D. 60. Paul spent years under arrest in Rome until his beheading under Nero in A.D. 67.

                  <h2>Gospel at Home</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Protect your Home and your family.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/gospel_at_home.jpg" alt="Gospel at Home">

<p>
The Gospel At Home is a special moment that family and friends can congregate on their homes to elevate their thoughts in prayer and study of The Gospel According the Spiritism book. Due to sharing thoughts nature of this experience, it helps each participant to understand each other's perspectives, ideas, beliefs, point of views, etc. The guidance found within "The Gospel According to Spiritism" invite participants to pursue a conscious effort towards their inner change. The educational and inspirational lessons raise awareness of their own moral strengths and weaknesses. The lessons of the Gospel At Home will inspire the participants to make the extra effort during difficult moments in their lives.
</p><p>
The quality and nature of the energies that we emit are directly related to the quality of thoughts that we entertain. When the members of a household gathers together to reflect upon the good teachings, their thoughts change and they emit strong currents of positive and purifying energies. These good energies impregnates the household  environment and facilitates the work of the good spirits.
</p><p>
The spirits that come to their aid work in favor of the family and household as a whole, guiding them with positive intuitions to keep an harmonious home. When participants work together to assist one another and to build a strong foundation of support, love, and understanding, the results are amplified. During the Gospel At Home meetings the good spirits will clean the fluidic environment (energy) in the home and magnetize the water that is set out before the meeting impregnating it with spiritual fluids of healthy and uplifting energies.
</p><br><p>
<b>How to make this moment very special</b>
</p><p>
The meeting should be around 30 minutes and it  needs to be held on the same day  at the same time each week. This is important to cooperate with the good spirits who come to assist. Occasionally, the meeting may be held at a different time when needed due to special circumstances. However, this should happen as an exception only. If one or more members is unable to attend on the regular day, the other members can continue to hold the meeting. If the whole family or household is traveling, it is possible to do the meeting, wherever they are.
</p><p>
The environment should be a place inside the home, where participants can feel comfortable and which allows for the open reading of books. If desired, soft music can be played in the background. There is no need for any kind of special decor, candles, or other objects. The only item you are advised to have on the table other than your books is a pitcher of water to be magnetized by the good spirits and the elevated thoughts of prayer to be distributed at the end of the meeting.
</p><p>
The book to be read should be "The Gospel According to Spiritism" and  a complementary reading. You can use a Spiritist book of inspirational messages, for example, to begin the meeting. "The Gospel According to Spiritism" can be read by opening the book at random or in sequence, the latter being advised for those who do not presently participate in any other orderly/systematic study of the Spiritism. Spiritist books for children can also be included if children are present.
</p><p>
<b>How to do it?</b>
</p><p>
<ul style="text-align: left"><li>
Begin with your complementary reading, such as a Spiritist book of inspirational messages, to help everyone focus on the study you are about to begin, leaving aside other concerns at that time.
</li><li>
Then, someone from the group should say a simple opening prayer or meditation, during which time the the participants should elevate their thoughts in order to connect mentally with one another and with the good spirits.
</li><li>
If children are present, you may want to start their reading first, using the children's books. They should be encouraged to make comments about the reading and to participate in prayers, as well.
</li><li>
You can now begin your reading of one item from "The Gospel According to Spiritism". Then, participants can offer comments according to their understanding of the reading. They should also try to relate the lesson contained in the reading to the events of their daily lives. If you are reading in sequence, you should take note of the place where you left off to begin there at the next meeting.
</li><li>
End the meeting with a closing prayer or meditation giving thanks for the blessings you have received, for this moment of study, and for the assistance of the good spirits. Also, ask for assistance for friends and loved ones, as well as for others who are in need or who may be suffering.
</li><li>
Distribute the magnetized water among participants.
</li>

Spiritual healing in Spiritism is a special aid to help improve your life, mind, body, and to facilitate the connection with your inner self.
</p><p>
The healers are trained to use the energy from the environment and deliver it into the chakras localized across the body. This process is running through a meditation in which the healer focus on each chakra by a color connected to it to restore and balance its own energy.
</p><p>
Our meetings start with an individual spiritual healing before the lecture and a final meditation at the end.

The light that shows us the way<br>
The light that keeps us warm<br>
